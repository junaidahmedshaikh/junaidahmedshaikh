## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m Junaid Ahmed Shaikh, a dedicated and detail-oriented Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in modern web development technologies. I specialize in building responsive, accessible, and user-centric web applications using JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS, and Material UI.

With a passion for clean code and thoughtful design, I strive to create seamless digital experiences that balance functionality with visual appeal. I’m equally comfortable collaborating with cross-functional teams or taking initiative on solo projects.

Currently, I’m expanding my backend skills using Node.js and deepening my understanding of full-stack development to deliver end-to-end solutions.
